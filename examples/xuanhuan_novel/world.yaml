cultivation_system:
  name: "天玄修炼体系 (Tianxuan Cultivation System)"
  description: >
    Practitioners absorb 灵气 (Spiritual Energy) from heaven and earth, refining
    it within their 丹田 (Dantian — energy center). Advancement requires breaking
    through bottlenecks, which becomes exponentially harder at higher realms. The
    path of cultivation has two pillars: 武修 (Martial Cultivation) for combat
    power, and 炼药 (Alchemy) for creating pills, poisons, and medicines.
  realms:
    - "斗者 (Dou Zhe / Fighter) — Initial awakening of spiritual energy"
    - "斗师 (Dou Shi / Master) — Can project energy externally"
    - "大斗师 (Da Dou Shi / Grand Master) — Energy takes solid form"
    - "斗灵 (Dou Ling / Spirit) — Spiritual awareness, can fly short distances"
    - "斗王 (Dou Wang / King) — Domain manifestation, true flight"
    - "斗皇 (Dou Huang / Emperor) — Space manipulation, devastating power"
    - "斗宗 (Dou Zong / Ancestor) — Can create pocket dimensions"
    - "斗尊 (Dou Zun / Venerable) — Approach the laws of heaven"
    - "斗圣 (Dou Sheng / Saint) — Transcend mortal limits"
    - "斗帝 (Dou Di / Emperor of Fighting) — Legendary, none in ten thousand years"
  rules:
    - "Cultivation requires 灵气 absorption and internal refinement"
    - "Higher realms exponentially harder — each breakthrough risks qi deviation"
    - "Rare treasures (天材地宝) can aid breakthroughs but attract deadly competition"
    - "Alchemy requires soul power — stronger soul = higher tier pills"
    - "天火 (Heavenly Flames) are ranked 1-23, each with unique properties"
    - "Blood contracts with magical beasts grant their power but bind fates"
    - "The 魂殿 (Soul Hall) controls soul cultivation secrets, demands tribute"

alchemy_system:
  name: "炼药术 (Art of Alchemy)"
  description: >
    Alchemists refine spiritual herbs into pills using cauldrons and soul fire.
    Pill tiers match cultivation realms. A skilled alchemist commands immense
    respect — even emperors seek their favor.
  tiers:
    - "一品 (Tier 1) — Basic healing and cultivation pills"
    - "二品 (Tier 2) — Advanced pills, require rare herbs"
    - "三品 (Tier 3) — Soul-strengthening pills, extremely valuable"
    - "四品 (Tier 4) — Can alter bloodlines and mend broken meridians"
    - "五品 (Tier 5) — Heaven-defying pills, each recipe a national treasure"
    - "六品+ (Tier 6+) — Legendary, pill tribulation from heaven"
  rules:
    - "Alchemy requires soul power to control flame precisely"
    - "Heavenly Flames are the best fuel — dramatically increase success rate"
    - "Failed pills can explode violently — alchemy is always dangerous"
    - "Pill patterns (丹纹) on the surface indicate quality — more patterns = better"

history:
  the_ancient_war: >
    Ten thousand years ago, the last 斗帝 (Dou Di) fought against the Nether Lord
    who tried to merge the mortal realm with the death realm. The Dou Di sacrificed
    himself to seal the Nether Abyss, but the seal was never meant to last forever.
    His inheritance — including a Heavenly Flame and cultivation manual — was
    scattered across the continent.
  the_soul_hall_rise: >
    Three hundred years ago, the 魂殿 (Soul Hall) emerged from the shadows,
    demanding all alchemists pay tribute or face destruction. They control the
    secrets of soul cultivation and use puppet corpses as weapons. Their true
    goal is unknown, but they seek the ancient Dou Di's inheritance.
