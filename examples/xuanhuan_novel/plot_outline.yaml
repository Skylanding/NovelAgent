premise: >
  林焱 (Lin Yan), once a cultivation genius, had his dantian shattered and soul
  damaged by a mysterious enemy at age 14, falling from prodigy to trash in the
  eyes of his clan. Three years later, a dying elder alchemist's soul merges with
  an ancient ring he carries, awakening the spirit of 药尘 (Yao Chen), a legendary
  Tier 6 alchemist who was betrayed and destroyed by the Soul Hall centuries ago.
