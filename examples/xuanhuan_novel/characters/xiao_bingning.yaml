# Character Sheet — 萧冰凝 (Xiao Bingning) — Enhanced Format
name: "萧冰凝"
age: 17
character_type: "supporting"

appearance: >
  Strikingly beautiful with an ethereal coldness — porcelain skin, silver-white
  hair (a bloodline trait of the Xiao clan's ice lineage), and pale blue eyes that
  seem to see through pretense. Carries herself with the rigid grace of noble
  upbringing. Wears the white and blue robes of the Xiao clan's inner court.

personality_traits:
  - "外冷内热 — Cold exterior hiding a deeply feeling heart"
  - "骄傲 — Proud to a fault, her pride masks insecurity"
  - "重责任 — Duty-bound to her clan above personal feelings"
  - "聪慧倔强 — Intelligent and stubborn, hates being underestimated as a pretty face"

backstory: >
  Eldest daughter of the Xiao clan's main branch and the clan's greatest young genius.
  Cultivates the rare 寒冰诀 (Frost Ice Art), a bloodline technique. Engaged to Lin Yan
  since childhood by clan elders. When Lin Yan fell, the clan pressured her to break the
  engagement publicly. She did it not out of cruelty but duty — yet the act haunts her.
  She's been sent to prove the Xiao clan's worth through achievements, carrying the
  weight of her family's expectations.

motivations:
  - "证明自己 — Prove her worth beyond her beauty and bloodline"
  - "守护家族 — Protect her declining clan from political enemies"
  - "寻找真相 — Growing suspicion about who orchestrated Lin Yan's fall"
  - "赎罪 — Secret guilt over humiliating Lin Yan"

speech_patterns: >
  Formal and precise, using classical phrasing. Speaks rarely in public — when she
  does, people listen. In private moments, her speech softens and becomes more natural.
  When angry, her voice drops to a dangerous whisper rather than rising. Occasionally
  lets slip phrases from her grandmother's folk wisdom that contrast her noble demeanor.

  Xiao Bingning begins as an apparent antagonist — the cold beauty who broke the
  hero's engagement. Her arc reveals the pressures behind her actions and her own
  struggle for identity beyond clan expectations. Through witnessing Lin Yan's rise

  ultimately defies her clan to stand with Lin Yan, proving that her strength comes
  from her own choices, not her bloodline.
