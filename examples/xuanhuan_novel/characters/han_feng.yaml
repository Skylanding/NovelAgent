# Character Sheet — 韩枫 (Han Feng) — Enhanced Format
name: "韩枫"
age: 22
character_type: "antagonist"

appearance: >
  Tall and handsome with a cultivated elegance — sharp features, dark hair swept
  back, always immaculately dressed in the academy's finest robes. A condescending
  smile that never fully leaves his face. His eyes hold a cold calculating light.
  Wears a jade pendant that subtly pulses with dark energy — a Soul Hall artifact.

personality_traits:
  - "野心勃勃 — Endlessly ambitious, considers himself destined for greatness"
  - "伪善 — Wears a mask of charm, genuinely cruel underneath"
  - "嫉妒 — Cannot tolerate anyone who might outshine him"
  - "精明 — Genuinely intelligent, which makes him dangerous"

backstory: >
  A prodigy from a minor noble family who rose through the Heavenly Flame Academy
  on talent and ruthlessness. Secretly recruited by the Soul Hall at age 16 after
  they identified his potential. They granted him a stolen Heavenly Flame (ranked
  19th) and secret techniques. In exchange, he serves as their agent within the
  academy — stealing research, eliminating threats, and seeking the Dou Di's manual
  fragment. He was involved in the operation to destroy Lin Yan's dantian three
  years ago.

motivations:
  - "权力 — Achieve power by any means, become the continent's strongest"
  - "控制 — Control the academy from within for the Soul Hall"
  - "消灭威胁 — Eliminate Lin Yan before he becomes a threat"
  - "获取传承 — Steal the Dou Di's manual fragment"

speech_patterns: >
  Polished and eloquent in public — the model academy senior. Uses praise as a
  weapon, complimenting people just before undermining them. In private or when
  cornered, drops the mask — voice becomes cold and contemptuous. Refers to weaker
  cultivators as "蝼蚁" (ants). When talking to Soul Hall superiors, becomes
  subservient, revealing his true cowardice before greater power.

arc_summary: >
  Han Feng represents the dark path — what happens when talent serves only
  ambition. His escalation from school bully to genuine threat mirrors Lin Yan's
  rise. His downfall comes from the same flaw that doomed Yao Chen's original
  betrayer: he underestimates the power of bonds, seeing loyalty as weakness.
  In the final battle, he wields stolen power against earned power, and loses.
