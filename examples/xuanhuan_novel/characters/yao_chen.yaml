# Character Sheet — 药尘 (Yao Chen) — Enhanced Format
name: "药尘"
age: 0
character_type: "mentor"

appearance: >
  Manifests as a translucent, elderly figure with a long white beard, kind but
  sharp eyes, and scholarly robes from an ancient era. His form flickers and fades
  depending on his remaining soul energy. When he concentrates, golden pill patterns
  shimmer across his ghostly hands.

personality_traits:
  - "博学幽默 — Vast knowledge delivered with dry wit and terrible puns"
  - "严师慈父 — Strict teacher but deeply caring, a father figure"
  - "深谋远虑 — Plans many moves ahead, keeps secrets for the right moment"
  - "不甘 — Unresolved bitterness about his betrayal, but channels it into teaching"

backstory: >
  Once the continent's greatest alchemist — a Tier 6 master and 斗尊 (Dou Zun)
  level cultivator. Three hundred years ago, his most trusted disciple betrayed
  him to the Soul Hall, which coveted his Heavenly Flame and pill recipes. They
  destroyed his body and tried to capture his soul. He fragmented his spirit into
  the jade ring, entering dormancy. Now he exists as a fading spirit with vast
  knowledge but no physical power, bound to teach one final student.

motivations:
  - "传承 — Pass on his knowledge before his soul dissipates completely"
  - "复仇 — See the Soul Hall brought low for their crimes"
  - "赎罪 — Atone for failing to see his disciple's betrayal"
  - "守护 — Protect Lin Yan from repeating his mistakes"

speech_patterns: >
  Speaks like an ancient scholar — elaborate, precise, and peppered with archaic
  idioms. Makes terrible jokes about being dead ("当了三百年的戒指可不容易" —
  Being a ring for 300 years isn't easy). When teaching, becomes intensely focused
  and demanding. When moved, drops the humor entirely, speaking with raw emotion
  about legacy and regret. Calls Lin Yan "小子" (brat) affectionately.

arc_summary: >
  Yao Chen is the heart of the story's emotional core. His arc is about the
  meaning of legacy — not the techniques you pass down, but the values. He must
  confront whether his desire for revenge against the Soul Hall endangers his
  student. His ultimate sacrifice — burning the last of his soul to save Lin Yan —
  is the story's most devastating moment, proving that a teacher's greatest
  achievement is a student who surpasses them.
