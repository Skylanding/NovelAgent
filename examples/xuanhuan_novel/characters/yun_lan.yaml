name: "云岚"
age: 18
character_type: "sidekick"

appearance: >
  Slender and agile with lively features — warm brown skin, windswept dark hair
  cut short for practicality, and bright amber eyes full of curiosity. Has a
  small wind-element tattoo on her wrist — the mark of the Misty Cloud Sect.
  Dresses in practical training robes rather than the elaborate outfits other
  sect disciples prefer.

personality_traits:
  - "活泼好奇 — Energetic and endlessly curious about everything"
  - "正义感强 — Strong sense of justice, hates bullying"
  - "粗心大意 — Careless about details and social propriety"
  - "忠诚 — Once she chooses a friend, she's loyal to the bone"

backstory: >
  A junior disciple of the Misty Cloud Sect sent to the Heavenly Flame Academy
  as a representative. Unlike her sect's arrogant reputation, Yun Lan is
  refreshingly straightforward. Her father was a commoner who married into the
  sect, giving her a different perspective than most cultivators. She's talented
  in wind techniques but struggles with the rigid hierarchy of cultivation society.
  She befriends Lin Yan not despite his reputation, but because she admires people
  who keep fighting.

motivations:
  - "变强 — Become strong enough to change the cultivation world's brutal hierarchy"
  - "友情 — Build genuine friendships beyond sect and clan politics"
  - "探索 — Explore the continent's mysteries and ancient ruins"
  - "家族荣誉 — Prove her commoner-blooded father deserves respect"

speech_patterns: >
  Speaks quickly and energetically, often interrupting herself. Uses colloquial
  language that shocks noble cultivators. Laughs easily and loudly. When angry,
  becomes bluntly confrontational — "你以为你很了不起？" (You think you're so great?).
  Calls Lin Yan "小焱" (Little Yan) despite his protests. Occasionally slips into
  her father's rustic proverbs.

arc_summary: >
  Yun Lan represents the heart of the group — the one who believes in friendship
  and justice in a world that rewards only power. Her arc is about discovering that
  idealism isn't naivety — it's a choice, and a powerful one. She provides crucial
  support through her wind abilities and social connections, and her loyalty becomes
  the glue that holds the alliance together in the final battle. She also learns
  to accept that caring for someone doesn't mean owning them.
