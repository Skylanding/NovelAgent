# Character Sheet — 林焱 (Lin Yan) — Enhanced Format
name: "林焱"
age: 17
character_type: "protagonist"

appearance: >
  Lean and sharp-featured with intense dark eyes that sometimes flash with golden
  flame when his emotions surge. Once had the healthy glow of a cultivator, now
  somewhat pale and thin from three years of decline. Black hair tied in a simple
  ponytail. Wears a worn jade ring on his left hand — the ancient ring containing
  Yao Chen's spirit. A faint scar runs across his chest where his dantian was shattered.

personality_traits:
  - "坚韧不屈 — Unyielding stubbornness, refuses to accept fate"
  - "隐忍 — Endures humiliation silently, waiting for the right moment"
  - "重情重义 — Values bonds deeply, never forgets kindness or grudges"
  - "聪慧 — Quick-witted and adaptive, turns disadvantages into advantages"

backstory: >
  Born into a minor branch of the Lin clan in Lanfeng Empire. Showed extraordinary
  cultivation talent as a child, reaching 斗师 (Dou Shi) at age 14 — unprecedented
  for his age. During a clan expedition, a mysterious figure shattered his dantian
  and damaged his soul, leaving him unable to cultivate. For three years he endured
  mockery and contempt, falling from genius to "trash." His engagement to Xiao
  Bingning of the Xiao clan became a joke. He carries his dead mother's jade ring,
  not knowing it holds a legendary alchemist's spirit.

motivations:
  - "恢复修为 — Reclaim his cultivation and surpass his former peak"
  - "查明真相 — Discover who destroyed his dantian and why"
  - "守护所爱 — Protect those who stood by him in his darkest days"
  - "报师恩 — Repay Yao Chen by finding a way to restore his soul"

speech_patterns: >
  Speaks with quiet confidence that unnerves those who expect a broken person.
  Uses few words in normal conversation but becomes eloquent when challenged.
  In moments of defiance, his voice carries a cold edge: "三十年河东，三十年河西，
  莫欺少年穷" (Don't bully the young and poor — fortunes change). When speaking
  with Yao Chen, shows respect but also dry humor. Never boasts — lets actions speak.

arc_summary: >
  Lin Yan's journey is the classic 逆天改命 (defying fate) arc. From a broken genius
  mocked as trash, he rises through alchemy and an unconventional cultivation path
  to surpass those who looked down on him. His core growth is learning that true
  strength isn't about power alone — it's about the bonds you forge and the sacrifices
  you're willing to make. His relationship with Yao Chen teaches him that receiving
  kindness creates a debt of the heart, and his greatest battle is choosing to protect
  others over pursuing personal vengeance.
