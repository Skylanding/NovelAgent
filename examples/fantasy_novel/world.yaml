    separates the mortal realm from the Void — weakens with each passing year.

magic_system:
  name: "Aethercraft"
  description: >
    Magic drawn from the Aetherveil — the membrane between the mortal world and
    the Void. Practitioners (Aethersmiths) channel aether through focus objects
    (crystals, runes, or the Crown shards themselves).
  rules:
    - "Aether use drains the Veil, hastening its collapse"
    - "Greater magic requires greater cost — physical pain, memory loss, or life force"
    - "The five Crown shards amplify aether enormously but corrupt the wielder over time"
    - "Void-touched creatures emerge where the Veil is thinnest"
    - "Natural aether regenerates slowly; forced extraction causes Blight"
  disciplines:
    - "Warding — defensive barriers and protections"
    - "Shaping — manipulating physical matter"
    - "Whispering — telepathy and emotional manipulation"
    - "Voidwalking — dangerous art of touching the Void directly"

history:
  the_sundering: >
    Three hundred years ago, King Aethel attempted to use the Crown to seal
    the Void permanently. The ritual failed catastrophically, shattering the
    Crown into five shards and devastating the continent. The blast created the
    Ashfield and weakened the Veil everywhere.
  current_era: >
    The kingdom is fractured. Noble houses fight for dominance. The Verdant Order
    guards the Thornwood and its secrets. The Wardens of the Peak defend against
    Void incursions in the mountains. Rumors spread that someone is collecting
    the shards.
