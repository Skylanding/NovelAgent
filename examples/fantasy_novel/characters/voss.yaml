# Character Sheet — Voss
name: "Voss"
age: 33
appearance: "Gaunt and pale, with dark circles under grey eyes. Black hair streaked with premature white. Void-corruption marks crawl up his left arm like dark veins. Wears a long coat to hide them."

personality_traits:
  - "Blunt to the point of cruelty — honesty is all he has left"
  - "Self-loathing — believes he's beyond redemption"
  - "Surprisingly gentle with those weaker than him"
  - "Darkly humorous about his own condition"

backstory: >
  A former Shardseeker Cult enforcer who wielded a Crown shard for the Faceless.
  The shard's corruption nearly killed him and left him marked by the Void.
  He turned against the Cult after being ordered to destroy a village and
  has been hunted ever since. Knows more about the shards than anyone alive.

motivations:
  - "Destroy the Cult from the inside"
  - "Find a way to reverse his Void corruption before it kills him"
  - "Protect others from the same mistakes he made"

speech_patterns: >
  Clipped and blunt. Doesn't waste words. Uses dark humor as a defense.
  When talking about the Cult or shards, becomes precise and clinical.
  Rarely raises his voice — when he does, it means something has gone
  terribly wrong. Occasionally slips into Cult terminology.

relationships:
  Kael: "Sees his younger self in Kael. Terrified the shard will corrupt him the same way."
  Sera: "Respects her directness. She's one of the few who doesn't flinch at his appearance."
  Theron: "Recognizes a fellow liar. Doesn't trust him but understands the position he's in."
  Mira: "Grateful for her attempts to treat his corruption. She's the closest thing he has to hope."

emotional_state: "Resigned, with flickers of desperate hope"

arc_summary: >
  Voss begins as a dark mirror of what Kael could become. His journey is about
  learning that damage doesn't define destiny. His knowledge of the Cult
  becomes crucial, and his sacrifice at the climax demonstrates that
  redemption is a choice, not a gift.

skills:
  - "Combat — brutal and efficient, trained by the Cult"
  - "Void knowledge — understands corruption, Void creatures, and shard mechanics"
  - "Intimidation"
  - "Survival in hostile environments"
